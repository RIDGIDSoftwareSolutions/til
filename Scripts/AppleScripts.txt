Today I learned some basic AppleScript writing.

I wrote a script to reset the simulator every time it is run.

If you want to reset the simulator every time you run your app, put this script in the schemes Run pre-actions
 
 Set Shell to: /usr/bin/osascript
  
  tell application "iOS Simulator"
  activate
    tell application "System Events"
	    tell process "iOS Simulator"
		    click menu item "Reset Content and Settingsâ€¦" of menu "iOS Simulator" of menu bar 1
			 tell window 1
		        click button "Reset"
		     end tell
	      end tell
	   end tell
	end tell

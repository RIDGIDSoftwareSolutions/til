Today I realized the long term tradeoffs of surging on a project to get it done.

Our massive www.ridgid.com project of a couple years ago necessitated that other teams join in and help in any way possible to get the project done. As such,
our data integration team wrote a number of batch jobs (mostly in Pentaho Data Integrator, aka "PDI" aka "Kettle") that interface with the system. As time goes by,
the RIDGID.com team often has to track down these jobs to understand what they are doing and to possibly make changes. The time and cost to working with the other
team to find these things, investigate, understand, and ultimately transfer ownership of them is not insignificant.

Lesson: pulling in temporary help to get something done has a long term cost.
